# ImageResizing

I am using the Accelerate framework to create new images of different sizes from originals.

The exercise first grabs the images from the Assets library, which is just to get the exercise off and running.  This stores them in the Caches directory.  From there the app pulls them from the directory, renders them as UIImages and re-sizes them, and shows the new re-sized images in a UiImageView.
